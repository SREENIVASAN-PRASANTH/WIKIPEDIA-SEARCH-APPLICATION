# WIKIPEDIA-SEARCH-APPLICATION
This project is a simple, interactive web application that allows users to search Wikipedia directly from the app. Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the app fetches search results from Wikipedia's API and displays them dynamically on the page.

Key features include:

Real-time Search: Users can search Wikipedia by typing a query and pressing "Enter".
Dynamic Content Display: Search results, including titles, URLs, and descriptions, are displayed in a clean, easy-to-read format.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless user experience across different devices.

This project serves as an example of working with APIs and dynamically updating the DOM with JavaScript, making it a great reference for learning or extending functionality in web development projects.
